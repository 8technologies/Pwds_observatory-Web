It is the opposite of melanism. Unlike humans, other animals have multiple pigments and for these, albinism is considered to be a hereditary condition characterised by the absence of pigment in the eyes, skin, hair, scales, feathers or cuticle.</p><p>Albinism is associated with a number of vision defects, such as photophobia, nystagmus and amblyopia. Lack of skin pigmentation makes for more susceptibility to sunburn and skin cancers. In rare cases such as Chédiak–Higashi syndrome, albinism may be associated with deficiencies in the transportation of melanin granules. This also affects essential granules present in immune cells leading to increased susceptibility to infection.</p><p>In humans, there are two principal types of albinism: oculocutaneous, affecting the eyes, skin and hair, and ocular affecting the eyes only.</p><p>Most people with oculocutaneous albinism appear white or very pale, as the melanin pigments responsible for brown, black, and some yellow colorations are not present. Ocular albinism results in light blue eyes, and may require genetic testing to diagnose.</p><p>Because individuals with albinism have skin that entirely lacks the dark pigment melanin, which helps protect the skin from the sun’s ultraviolet radiation, their skin can burn more easily from overexposure.</p><p>The human eye normally produces enough pigment to colour the iris blue, green or brown and lend opacity to the eye. In photographs, those with albinism are more likely to demonstrate “red eye,” due to the red of retina being visible through the iris. Lack of pigment in the eyes also results in problems with vision, both related and unrelated to photosensitivity.</p>'),(9,'2023-03-02 15:03:50','2023-03-02 15:03:50','Dwarfism','images/pinews-jb-dwarf-ug-jpg.jpg','<p>Dwarfism is short stature that results from a genetic or medical condition. Dwarfism is generally defined as an adult height of 4 feet 10 inches (147 centimeters) or less. The average adult height among people with dwarfism is 4 feet (122 cm).</p><p>Many different medical conditions cause dwarfism. In general, the disorders are divided into two broad categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Disproportionate dwarfism.</strong>&nbsp;If body size is disproportionate, some parts of the body are small, and others are of average size or above-average size. Disorders causing disproportionate dwarfism inhibit the development of bones.</li><li><strong>Proportionate dwarfism.</strong>&nbsp;A body is proportionately small if all parts of the body are small to the same degree and appear to be proportioned like a body of average stature. Medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood limit overall growth and development.</li></ul><p>Some people prefer the term \"short stature\" or \"little people\" rather than \"dwarf\" or \"dwarfism.\" So it\'s important to be sensitive to the preference of someone who has this disorder. Short stature disorders do not include familial short stature — short height that\'s considered a normal variation with normal bone development.</p><h3><strong>Products &amp; Services</strong></h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://order.store.mayoclinic.com/books/gnweb43?utm_source=MC-DotOrg-PS&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_campaign=FamilyHealth-Book&amp;utm_content=FHB\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 61, 165);\">Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition</a></li></ul><p>Show more products from Mayo Clinic</p><p><br></p><h2>Symptoms</h2><p>Signs and symptoms — other than short stature — vary considerably across the spectrum of disorders.</p><h3><strong>Disproportionate dwarfism</strong></h3><p>Most people with dwarfism have disorders that cause disproportionately short stature. Usually, this means that a person has an average-size trunk and very short limbs, but some people may have a very short trunk and shortened (but disproportionately large) limbs. In these disorders, the head is disproportionately large compared with the body.</p><p>Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities. Rare exceptions are usually the result of a secondary factor, such as excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus).</p><p>The most common cause of dwarfism is a disorder called achondroplasia, which causes disproportionately short stature. This disorder usually results in the following:</p><ul><li>An average-size trunk</li><li>Short arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs</li><li>Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers</li><li>Limited mobility at the elbows</li><li>A disproportionately large head, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose</li><li>Progressive development of bowed legs</li><li>Progressive development of swayed lower back</li><li>An adult height around 4 feet (122 cm)</li></ul><p>Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Signs may include:</p><ul><li>A very short trunk</li><li>A short neck</li><li>Shortened arms and legs</li><li>Average-size hands and feet</li><li>Broad, rounded chest</li><li>Slightly flattened cheekbones</li><li>Opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate)</li><li>Hip deformities that result in thighbones turning inward</li><li>A foot that\'s twisted or out of shape</li><li>Instability of the neck bones</li><li>Progressive hunching curvature of the upper spine</li><li>Progressive development of swayed lower back</li><li>Vision and hearing problems</li><li>Arthritis and problems with joint movement</li><li>Adult height ranging from 3 feet (91 cm) to just over 4 feet (122 cm)</li></ul><h3><strong>Proportionate dwarfism</strong></h3><p>Proportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. So the head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they\'re proportionate to each other. Because these disorders affect overall growth, many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems.</p><p>Growth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism. It occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce an adequate supply of growth hormone, which is essential for normal childhood growth. Signs include:</p><ul><li>Height below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth charts</li><li>Growth rate slower than expected for age</li><li>Delayed or no sexual development during the teen years</li></ul><h3><strong>When to see a doctor</strong></h3><p>Signs and symptoms of disproportionate dwarfism are often present at birth or in early infancy. Proportionate dwarfism may not be immediately apparent. See your child\'s doctor if you have any concerns about your child\'s growth or overall development.</p>');
